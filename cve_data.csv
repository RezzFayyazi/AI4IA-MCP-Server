When curl is asked to pass along the host name to the SOCKS5 proxy to allow
that to resolve the address instead of it getting done by curl itself, the
maximum length that host name can be is 255 bytes.

If the host name is detected to be longer, curl switches to local name
resolving and instead passes on the resolved address only. Due to this bug,
the local variable that means ""let the host resolve the name"" could get the
wrong value during a slow SOCKS5 handshake, and contrary to the intention,
copy the too long host name to the target buffer instead of copying just the

This leads to the overwriting of nearby stack memory. The content of the overwrite is decided by the `free()` implementation; likely to be memory pointers and a set of flags.

When curl is asked to pass along the host name to the SOCKS5 proxy to allow
that to resolve the address instead of it getting done by curl itself, the
maximum length that host name can be is 255 bytes.

If the host name is detected to be longer, curl switches to local name
resolving and instead passes on the resolved address only. Due to this bug,
the local variable that means ""let the host resolve the name"" could get the
wrong value during a slow SOCKS5 handshake, and contrary to the intention,
copy the too long host name to the target buffer instead of copying just the

Itcan detect an invalid field and return error. Unfortunately, when doing so it also invokes `free()` on a 4 byte localstack buffer.  Most modern malloc implementations detect this error and immediately abort. Some however accept the input pointer and add that memory to its list of available chunks. This leads to the overwriting of nearby stack memory. The content of the overwrite is decided by the `free()` implementation; likely to be memory pointers and a set of flags.

handshake.

When curl is asked to pass along the host name to the SOCKS5 proxy to allow
that to resolve the address instead of it getting done by curl itself, the
maximum length that host name can be is 255 bytes.

If the host name is detected to be longer, curl switches to local name
resolving and instead passes on the resolved address only. Due to this bug,
the local variable that means ""let the host resolve the name"" could get the
wrong value during a slow SOCKS5 handshake, and contrary to the intention,
copy the too long host name to the target buffer instead of copying just the
resolved address there.

URL that curl has been told to operate with.",High,CVE-2023-38545

When curl is asked to pass along the host name to the SOCKS5 proxy to allow
that to resolve the address instead of it getting done by curl itself, the
maximum length that host name can be is 255 bytes.

If the host name is detected to be longer, curl switches to local name
resolving and instead passes on the resolved address only. Due to this bug,
the local variable that means ""let the host resolve the name"" could get the
wrong value during a slow SOCKS5 handshake, and contrary to the intention,
copy the too long host name to the target buffer instead of copying just the

This leads to the overwriting of nearby stack memory. The content of the overwrite is decided by the `free()` implementation; likely to be memory pointers and a set of flags.

handshake.

When curl is asked to pass along the host name to the SOCKS5 proxy to allow
that to resolve the address instead of it getting done by curl itself, the
maximum length that host name can be is 255 bytes.

If the host name is detected to be longer, curl switches to local name
resolving and instead passes on the resolved address only. Due to this bug,
the local variable that means ""let the host resolve the name"" could get the
wrong value during a slow SOCKS5 handshake, and contrary to the intention,
copy the too long host name to the target buffer instead of copying just the

Itcan detect an invalid field and return error. Unfortunately, when doing so it also invokes `free()` on a 4 byte localstack buffer.  Most modern malloc implementations detect this error and immediately abort. Some however accept the input pointer and add that memory to its list of available chunks. This leads to the overwriting of nearby stack memory. The content of the overwrite is decided by the `free()` implementation; likely to be memory pointers and a set of flags.

When curl is asked to pass along the host name to the SOCKS5 proxy to allow
that to resolve the address instead of it getting done by curl itself, the
maximum length that host name can be is 255 bytes.

If the host name is detected to be longer, curl switches to local name
resolving and instead passes on the resolved address only. Due to this bug,
the local variable that means ""let the host resolve the name"" could get the
wrong value during a slow SOCKS5 handshake, and contrary to the intention,
copy the too long host name to the target buffer instead of copying just the
resolved address there.

Microsoft is aware of targeted attacks that attempt to exploit this vulnerability by using specially-crafted Microsoft Office documents.</p>
<p>An attacker could craft a malicious ActiveX control to be used by a Microsoft Office document that hosts the browser rendering engine. The attacker would then have to convince the user to open the malicious document. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.</p>
<p>Microsoft Defender Antivirus and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint both provide detection and protections for the known vulnerability. Customers should keep antimalware products up to date. Customers who utilize automatic updates do not need to take additional action. Enterprise customers who manage updates should select the detection build 1.349.22.0 or newer and deploy it across their environments. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint alerts will be displayed as: “Suspicious Cpl File Execution”.</p>

handshake.

When curl is asked to pass along the host name to the SOCKS5 proxy to allow
that to resolve the address instead of it getting done by curl itself, the
maximum length that host name can be is 255 bytes.

If the host name is detected to be longer, curl switches to local name
resolving and instead passes on the resolved address only. Due to this bug,
the local variable that means ""let the host resolve the name"" could get the
wrong value during a slow SOCKS5 handshake, and contrary to the intention,
copy the too long host name to the target buffer instead of copying just the
resolved address there.

Itcan detect an invalid field and return error. Unfortunately, when doing so it also invokes `free()` on a 4 byte localstack buffer.  Most modern malloc implementations detect this error and immediately abort. Some however accept the input pointer and add that memory to its list of available chunks. This leads to the overwriting of nearby stack memory. The content of the overwrite is decided by the `free()` implementation; likely to be memory pointers and a set of flags.
